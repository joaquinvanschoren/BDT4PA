# Big Data Tools for Physics and Astronomy

Materials for a talk in the workshop on Big Data Tools for Physics and Astronomy

The Jupyter Notebook shows how to use OpenML to:  
- browse data and tasks
- download data from the MAGIC Telescope
- build machine learning models
- compare it to all previous models built on that dataset
